# Self-Hosting Guide for Logicle

Logicle can be hosted by yourself on a variety of platforms:
- üê≥ Docker
- üì¶ Docker Compose
- ‚öì Kubernetes with Helm Chart (planned for future release)


## Docker
The easiest method to try out Logicle is by using a Docker container.

Currently, Logicle supports two different database engines:
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL

SQLite is the simplest to begin with as it doesn't require any external dependencies. Deployments using SQLite are ideal for personal, family, or small business use.

Deployments with PostgreSQL need more resources but are better suited for larger enterprise environments, capable of supporting hundreds of users.


### SQLite
By default, the Docker container uses an embedded SQLite database, so no external database is required.

```bash
# Start Logicle with SQLite, without data persistence
docker run -d --name logicle \
-p 3000:3000 \
ghcr.io/logicleai/logicle:latest
```

After starting, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000, where you can create your first user.

To maintain the SQLite database data between container restarts, you should bind mount the directory that contains the SQLite database to your machine's filesystem using the command below:

```bash
# Start Logicle with SQLite, with data persistence
docker run -d --name logicle \
-v "$(pwd)"/logicle:/tmp/ \
-p 3000:3000 \
ghcr.io/logicleai/logicle:latest
```

This command ensures that your data persists across container restarts by storing it in a specified directory on your machine.
