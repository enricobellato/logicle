# Self-Hosting Guide for Logicle

Logicle can be self-hosted on several platforms:
- 🐳 Docker --> [Check out the Official Docs](./docker/README.md)
- 📦 Docker Compose --> [Check out the Official Docs](./docker-compose/README.md)
- ⚓ Kubernetes with Helm Chart (coming soon)

## Supported databases
Logicle has also multi database engine support, currently logicle support:
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL

SQLite is the simplest to begin with as it doesn't require any external dependencies. Deployments using SQLite are ideal for personal, family, or small business use.

Deployments with PostgreSQL are better suited for larger enterprise environments, capable of supporting hundreds of users.
